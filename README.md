# Space Station 15
A 3D voxel remake of Space Station 13

# About
Space Station 15, or SS15, is a WIP 3D voxel game about survival on a deep space death trap.

Currently, Godot is the prospective engine for SS15

# Plans
This area is to list out development plans, and give a clear checklist for features.
Long term goals begin with a *, and are major features in the coming development. 

*No UI required for interaction
    -Hacking is done by hand, on a door
    -Other interactions in the form of buttons and button combinations
    -Talking and inventory have UI
*Combat is FPS-like, with a crosshair and bullet spread cones.
    -Potential weapon rebalance(?)
*3D movement, multiple floors for station
*Advanced graphics techniques like PBR, maints dust, and rays.
Possible tool to bypass needing Godot engine to develop content
*SS13 Codebase approach to servers
